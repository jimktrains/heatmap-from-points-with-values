Heatmaps from Points with Values
================================

Creates a heat map from the values of points, not their density

The values used for decay were chosen for aesthetic values and based on
an exponential decay function.

Extents for the image are chosen from the bounds of the data with some
padding.

The input format is expected to be

   Lat,Lon,Strength
   <lat>,<lon>,<strength>
